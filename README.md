# Machine Learning Udacity Nanodegree - Deep Learning

ConvNet project. 

### The original repo from `https://github.com/udacity/dog-project`

I will be editing the `dog_app.ipynb` file to make the code functional and answer the questions.

The dog dataset, human dataset, and VGG-16 bottleneck features are not included in this repo due to size. To Download them and place them in the right path locally look in `ORIGINAL_README`.

* Build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
